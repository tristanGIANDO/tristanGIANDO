Hi ! Iâ€™m **Tristan Giandoriggio**

Passionate about **science** and **cinema** since childhood, I graduated in **3D engineering** from **ESMA-Montpellier** in 2022 after directing the short film "Instinct".
I'm currently **Pipeline TD / rigger** at **The Beast Makers**.

I'm in charge of creating tools to make artists' work easier and I try to improve their working comfort.
I manage the creation of the pipeline and help track tasks, while helping artists with their projects (review, debugging, scripting, roles and permissions).
I also do rigging (mechanics/body/face/creature) and give general 3D lessons via **Superprof**.
I can do CFX (Houdini) and compositing (Nuke).


I've recently started a career change, focusing more on science than cinema.

**I'm aiming for the aerospace software and tools development sector, where I'd like to put my 3D and coding skills to good use.
I also do astrophotography.**
