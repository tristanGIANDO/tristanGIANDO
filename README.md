ðŸŽ¬ With a **Bac+5 in 3D Animation**, and a **Bac+4 as a Machine Learning Engineer**, I want to combine 3D and Data Science to meet new market needs.

ðŸŽ¯In a few words, specialized in **rigging and compositing**, I've so far been mainly responsible for managing the pipeline of a 3D/VFX production.
My tasks consisted in defining workflows, creating tools/APIs/bots to help artists on a production as well as tools to manage the company.

ðŸ’»Gradually, I'm evolving into the role of **data engineer**, helping to create and curate datasets for training models.
My goal is always to understand problems as a whole to find the best solutions.

ðŸŽ“ At the same time, I've taken courses in general physics, aeronautics and diving, as well as teaching courses in the 3D professions.
I also have a deep passion for the Universe and a great interest in the fields of defense.

Feel free to send a message ðŸ˜‰
