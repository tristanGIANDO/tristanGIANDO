Hi ! Iâ€™m **Tristan Giandoriggio**

I graduated from ESMA-Montpellier in 2022 after directing the short film **Instinct**. I am currently **Pipeline TD / rigger** at **The Beast Makers**.

I'm in charge of **creating tools to make artists' work easier** and I try to improve their work comfort.
Since April 2023, I'm slowly starting to work as a **production manager** on upcoming projects. I manage the creation of the **pipeline** and the **tracking of tasks** and I help the artists according to their needs on the projects (review, debug, script, roles and permissions).
I also do **rigging** (all types of rigs + script in Python)
Since February 2023, I give general 3D beginners courses via Superprof.

During my last year of study, I was in charge of the **pipeline** and **production**. I also did **body/face/creature rigging, CFX (Houdini) and compositing (Nuke)**.
